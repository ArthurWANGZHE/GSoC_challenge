# Basic Info
Greetings! I'm an undergraduate majoring in Robotic Science from China. I'm intrigued by JdeRobot, especially the exercises provided on the web. I have several development experiences, but I haven't had the chance to be a part of an open-source program. I hope this could be my first time entering the world of open-source development.

# Education
I took C++ courses in my freshman year at our university. Later, I had some practice opportunities on the Trail Trolley project and other small designs; basically, my C++ experience was on stm32.
What really introduced me to the world of computer science and development is CS61A, the open courses from UCB. Through which I found the beauty of coding and developing, and since then, I've started to take open courses from CS, DS to RS, and some math courses (18.06 and 18.103 etc). Later, I joined a student society of developers in which I learned about web backend, database, machine learning, etc. (I will clarify some of the major projects later). In this society, I've also learned about working in a team, about Code Specification, Version Management, etc. It feels like magic to be a part of such a group.
Last summer, I joined a summer camp of ROS where I learned the basic operation of Linux and ROS, of course. In this summer camp, we coded on different robots to overcome different tasks, which was very different from any online courses. This provided me not only theoretical knowledge but real operating experience and cutting-edge design.

# Projects
I list some of the major projects I've participated in these years (kind of a milestone for myself):

## Mewstore
**Python, Web Backend**
This is a multi-platform secondhand trading app. Users can trade with others and communicate with others. It has a functional register system including checking SMS-code, email, and ID card, and a chatting system is also included. Users can visit it through web, Android, and iOS.
I was mainly responsible for backend design, including the writing and testing of all APIs. I also shouldered some part of iOS development (I'm a big fan of Apple).

## Image Classification
**Python, CV, ML, Docker**
This was the last CV project in the student society. I tried several models including VGG, KNN, ResNet, etc. In this phase, study was still the main purpose. I was working on **CIFAR-100**, reading papers, trying, testing all different methods.

## Person Tracking Drone
**Python, ROS, C++, MV, Linux**
This was a simulation competition. We used algorithms to control drones to search for people in a map, including identifying and tracking specific people and avoiding certain obstacles.
In this project, I was mainly responsible for coding the upper monitor.

## DM-Locating
**ROS, Python, C++, MV, Linux**
This is a project working with my professor. We seek a way to let robots locate DM-codes on boxes in a warehouse with minimal costs. Also, real factors are all considered, including deviation and misoperation, etc. We found a way to improve accuracy through algorithms.
In this project, I was mainly responsible for coding the upper monitor.

# Hopes
I know I will definitely learn a lot through the project, from coding to robotics, etc. So, I hope I can meet more friends, be accepted by the org, and become a part of the open-source development, and continuously make contributions to the org.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
