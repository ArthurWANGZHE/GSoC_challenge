# Basic Info
Greetings! I'm an undergraduate student from China, majoring in Robotic Science. I've been captivated by the fascinating world of JdeRobot, particularly the exercises available on the web. They've sparked my curiosity and fueled my passion for robotics. While I have several development experiences under my belt, I've yet to have the opportunity to contribute to an open-source project. I am eager to dive into the open-source community and I hope that this will be my gateway into this exciting realm of collaborative development.

## Projects
Here are some of the major projects I've had the privilege to be a part of over the years. Each one represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer:

### Mewstore
Mewstore is a multi-platform secondhand trading app that I helped develop. It provides a platform for users to trade items and communicate with each other. The app features a robust registration system that includes SMS-code, email, and ID card verification. It also includes a fully functional chat system. Mewstore is accessible across web, Android, and iOS platforms.

Responsibilities
I was responsible for the writing and testing of all APIs, as well as iOS development.

### Image Classification
Technologies: Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Docker
This project was my final Computer Vision project in the student society. I experimented with several models including VGG, KNN, ResNet, etc., focusing primarily on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The main goal of this project was to learn and explore different methods through reading papers and testing various approaches.

### Person Tracking Drone
This project was part of a simulation competition. We developed algorithms to control drones, enabling them to search for people on a map. The drones were capable of identifying and tracking specific individuals while avoiding obstacles.

Responsibilities
I was responsible for working with ROS and overseeing the upper monitor.

### DM-Locating
Technologies: ROS, Python, C++, Machine Vision, Linux
This project was a collaboration with my professor. Our goal was to develop a cost-effective method for robots to locate DM-codes on boxes in a warehouse. We considered real-world factors such as deviation and misoperation. Through our work, we were able to improve accuracy using algorithmic solutions.

Responsibilities
I was in charge of the upper monitor and the development of the algorithm.

# Hopes
I am certain that this project will be a treasure trove of learning opportunities for me, from honing my coding skills to deepening my understanding of robotics. But beyond the technical knowledge, I am excited about the human connections I will make. I hope to meet like-minded friends, passionate individuals who share my love for robotics and coding. I aspire to be accepted by the organization, to become an integral part of the open-source development community. I am committed to not just being a passive participant, but an active contributor who continuously adds value to the organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of joining your esteemed organization and look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the world of open-source development.
