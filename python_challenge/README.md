# Ball Collision Simulator

This Python program uses the Pygame library to simulate the motion of a ball bouncing off the walls of a square window.

## Description

The program initializes a ball at the center of the window with a certain velocity. The ball then moves in a straight line until it collides with a wall, at which point it bounces back. The direction of the bounce is determined by the wall the ball hits.

## Features

- The ball's motion is smooth and continuous.
- The ball's collisions with the walls are perfectly elastic, i.e., the ball's speed is conserved.
- The program runs indefinitely until manually terminated.

## Customization

Users are encouraged to modify and experiment with the code. Possible customizations include changing the ball's initial position, velocity, size, and color.
