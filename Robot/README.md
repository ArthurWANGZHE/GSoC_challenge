# LocalizedVacuum Cleaner

This Python program uses the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) modules to control an autonomous robot. The robot uses laser data to navigate its environment, stopping and changing direction when it gets too close to an obstacle.



## Features

- Autonomous navigation: The robot can navigate its environment without human intervention.
- Obstacle avoidance: The robot uses laser data to detect and avoid obstacles.
- Real-time visualization: The robot's laser data is visualized in real-time.
